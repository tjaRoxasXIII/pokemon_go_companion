# PokemonGoCompanion

This app is designed as a companion to the Pokemon Go mobile app.  It can help you learn basic information about specific characters from the game by searching their name, number, or type.  It also provides insight on individual types and their accompanying strengths and weaknesses.  Once you're in the repo, you can use the following command to begin the app:


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'pokemon_go_companion'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install pokemon_go_companion

## Usage

To run this file starting from the main pokemon_go_companion directory, just type ``'ruby ./bin/console'`` and the application will begin.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
